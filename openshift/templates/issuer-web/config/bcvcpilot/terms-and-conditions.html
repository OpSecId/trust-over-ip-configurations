  <p>This is a pilot program intended to demonstrate the Person credential and it is still being developed. The Person
    credential is only meant to be used with collaborating services and does not replace your physical ID. The
    invitation credential is intended to invite individuals to the pilot program and is not intended to be part of the
    final product. The invitation credential can only be issued once. Please do not delete the invitation credential
    from your wallet until the pilot program is over. If you experience any issues or would like to provide feedback,
    please contact <a href="mailto:DITRUST@gov.bc.ca">DITRUST@gov.bc.ca</a>.</p>
