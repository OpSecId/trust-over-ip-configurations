	<p>This is a Proof of Concept service operated for the purposes of the BC VC Pilot Program. It demonstrates how an individual can receive a verifiable credential issued by an authority (the Government of BC) containing information that authority knows about you.</p>
	<p>When the QR code to receive your digital credential is displayed, use your digital wallet app (you have one right? If not, please <a href="https://vonx.io/getwallet" target="_blank">download a digital wallet</a>) to scan the code and follow the instructions in your wallet app.</p>
